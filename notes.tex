\begin{question}[class=easy]
John leaves home at 8:00 A.M. riding his mountain bike. He pedals at a constant rate of 15 ft/s. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item How far has John ridden at 8:10 A.M.?
\item How far has John ridden at 8:20 A.M.?
\item How far has John ridden at 8:45 A.M.?

\begin{question}[class=easy]
Pete, John's older brother, leaves 10 minutes after John, heading down the sam trail. He rides at 20 ft/sec.
\begin{enumerate}
\item How far has Pete ridden at 8:10 A.M.? Has Pete caught John?
\item How far has Pete ridden at 8:20 A.M.? Has Pete caught John?
\item How far has Pete ridden at 8:45 A.M.? Has Pete caught John?

\end{question}
\begin{solution}
\begin{enumerate}
\item 0 ft; Pete has not caught John
\item 1200 ft or 2.25mi; Pete has not caught John
\item 42,000 ft or about 8 mi; Pete has passed John
\item $1200(t-10)$, where $t\geq$10

\begin{question}[class=medium]

\begin{question}[class=medium]
Toby drives exactly 200 miles from San Jose to Morro Bay, CA. The trip takes exactly four hours. Show that at some point in the trip, Tony's speedometer indicates a speed of exactly 50 miies per hour.
\end{question}
\begin{solution}
Average speed was $\frac{200}{4}=50$ miles per hour and by IVT if there is a time $t_{1}$ where he is going less than 50 mph and a time $t_{2}$ where he is going more than 50 mph there must be a time where he is going exactly 50 mph. \cite[p.177]{Project2008}

\begin{question}[class=medium]
In parts \ref{MOA} and \ref{MOB}, use the velocity/time graph to answer the questions. Assume that North is positive and South is negative. Time is measured in hours and velocity in miles per hour. You start your journey from home at noon\footnote{We know it is unrealistic to instantly change from $0mph$ to $-30mph$ at 0 hours. Calculus addresses this situation.}.
